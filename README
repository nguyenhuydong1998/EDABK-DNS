Usage : ./examples/rnnoise_demo <speech file> <denoised file> <pitch_file.txt>
  * speech file : PCM 16bit 48 kHz
  * denoised file: PCM 16 bit 48 kHz
  * pitch_file.txt : file contain pitch index of each frame of speech file
Matlab test pitch analysis:
  * MAE.m : mean asbsolute error
  * testpitch.m : 
    Input: file wav of clean speech, noise and SNR
    Output: Variance of pitch index of clean and noisy speech
You can adapt testpitch.m to compare pitch analysis of rnnoise with function built-in pitch on matlab.
